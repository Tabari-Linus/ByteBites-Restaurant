# ByteBites Microservices Platform - Code Review Report

## Executive Summary

The ByteBites project is well-structured and module providing separation of concerns. The architecture demonstrates good understanding of microservices patterns, with proper separation of concerns, security implementation, and event-driven communication. However, there are several areas that i think could be improve to make the project more robust such as containerization, and monitoring on some services

## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clean microservices architecture with proper service boundaries and separation of concerns.
- The implementation of JWT and OAuth2 was comprehensive and well implemented for better security.
- Good use of Spring Cloud components such as the spring gateway,spring eureka, and config server.
- For Event-driven communication, RabbitMQ was used which was implemented well.
- Proper resource ownership and RBAC implementation was made allowing restaurant owners to only access restaurants their restaurants related materails and customers only see their orders and stuff.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missing Docker containerization: The project lacked a Docker containerization which is crucial for the deployment and robustness of the use of the application
- Inconsistent Spring Boot versions across services: The version of dependencies in the project weren't consistent for different services on the project.
- Limited error handling and validation: Though there was error handling and validation on some services and inputs, the validation wasn't consistent and some use
- Missing monitoring and observability for some services: Some services s
- No distributed tracing implementation

## 1. Microservice Design and Structure

### Strengths

**Service Decomposition:**

Well-defined service boundaries (Auth, Restaurant, Order, Discovery)
Each service has a clear, single responsibility with proper separation of business logic across services
The project isn't a "distributed monolith." Each service has a clear job, which is the 1st rule of microservices. This makes it easier to manage, scale, and update individual parts of the application without breaking everything

**Service Independence:**

Services can be developed and deployed independently as each service has its own database.

### Issues and Recommendations

**1.1 Inconsistent Service Registration**
```yaml
# restaurant-service/application.yml - Line 15-19
#  cloud:
#    config:
#      discovery:
#        enabled: true
#        service-id: config-server
```
Restaurant service has commented-out config server configuration, meaning it is using local profile configuration.

**Recommendation:** Standardize configuration across all services to maintain consistency over the services for easy deployment and avoid issues that might results when shipping to production or other deployment environment.

**1.2 Missing Service Health Checks**
No health check endpoints implemented for restaurant service and authservice.

**Recommendation:** Add Spring Boot Actuator to all services for health monitoring especially restaurant and auth service.

---

## 2. Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Usage

### Strengths

**Spring Cloud Components:**
- Proper use of Eureka for service registry and discovery
- Spring Cloud Gateway for API routing and authenication.
- Spring Cloud Stream for messaging

**Spring Boot Features:**
- Good use of Spring Data JPA, proper security configuration and Lombok for reducing boilerplate

### Issues and Recommendations

**2.1 Version Inconsistencies**
```xml
<!-- api-gateway/pom.xml - Line 6 -->
<version>3.3.13</version>
        <!-- Other services use 3.5.3 -->
```
- API Gateway uses Spring Boot 3.3.13 while other services use 3.5.3
- **Recommendation:** Standardize Spring Boot version across all services will reduces issues of inconsistent independence conflict.

**2.2 Missing Resilience Patterns**
- Only order-service has Resilience4j circuit breaker for resilence
- **Recommendation:** Implement circuit breakers for all service-service communication to ensure there are not cascading failure of services.

**2.3 Incomplete Spring Cloud Stream Configuration**
```yaml
# order-service/application.yml - Lines 18-25
spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      bindings:
        destination: order-events
        contentType: application/json
```
- Stream configuration is inconsistent and incomplete over some services
- **Recommendation:** Complete the Spring Cloud Stream configuration for proper event handling

---

## 3. Security Implementation

### Strengths

**JWT Implementation:**
Proper RSA key-based JWT signing, JWT validation in API Gateway and Role-based access control (RBAC)

**OAuth2 Authorization Server:**
Well-implemented OAuth2 authorization server in auth-service with proper JWT endpoint for token validation
Secure token generation and validation for Oauth2 users

**Resource Ownership:**
Proper implementation of resource ownership checks. Users can only access their own data

### Issues and Recommendations

**3.1 Hardcoded RSA Keys**
```yaml
# auth-service/application.yml - Lines 25-26
jwt:
  rsa:
    private-key: MIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQC87F/mNwChRG7XJZ7B13tmMWuowSPUAlGefCSFAsNEFimiq4LFlto7KMQJLRNCLHoyaMhSwmG4VDtfS0C+f4FCd4V70ZukrmfX5pvgNo4M7B+Ckr8VsJjH1MW3JGKPHOx3AQptcxbog5kJqxZ96GR6aT94hV29xkVE40AWe+hxzGI8wT4QwAZciMitGoAKJidg4FwL5b3BdLczAPc9tLAFNXWiqE/GC4/sEV6ga95GzqkLKJryDJW+8qEQlPUcUrswCxrU008uUgupy6gm/czLHqW3ng0vfRW4u/Bx6D38tpCbDZNWeuyRmggZBp06dOxibZR9vdEwqseyotm1ucglAgMBAAECggEADlhjKRzwvE4bndSVIHeXPs7uiNWEPfCgd/NJ5purbhEXakBcYVqEtEydI2vmdCDidSTFs/BfRoWG2Jk4j6ko4dN83EZclihJaaMbdO6k4fr6ot83s+hBQZ3jbCD5fDp1riJIbhUjc9ZXmYdXNt+djuSiVX7IURpWtNYN+Lxsja9rcyesgW4Fb7Xq9o6nXBBCzBfcQDu6d7QMKXUBY4VcoMuuDk6YdrmhJfXoySMB0usAUVTrT4AWeqvpoYZIjHurzYX+J3/v3vFWGMU53tDThToERu0BkzSIBmGozMRxXx9M2m6Fu4U2AliqyRI2PUmiJzARE+fNUzaYkyjGL2wXQQKBgQDuYJJCz5t5OfD+Mjo7tphUOCZa5HnfdHrLh4nj5Iw1ldFBy9yLdrmbbzHRFuBsYBEzJUzxgAXGcmzq/9Bse04vvbu0Vik4Ec2f9zJlR90Q6Hx/ASkzzZboLwqPcWxkguTZ3Bv8mSy1yux3vhQy88d6mew7Z4x61p2sf8X2xRLKNQKBgQDK49wA36W7mjcTqN584Jjo1TeT2VBlUVKMKilwKNkt0+EHenBCuW0W4+lf3se0VfywiyJCwn9/TKxzIdWOx6hcQ0i/FuXvLibXyscU4QM47LBOe0PDcIDs3FgzawuKjLLdvJefcsiw220mXF7OycMYvmTVqsjt8BTm+p381x9EMQKBgQCqjIt4o6K/7BWhOPxzBqQb9YRzmW4c0vCcN+APHdC28failaG4YnxPWhIRX8W3pFAKAND5JDh9kBafV+GeC+aXv67RSqf5BrvQjIMQ9YaT91JDZ+g7uQcUHbv3fxYnH4Nu381iP5E+i+39ihBXmBULgZ8DrYVTycNLzKstcDiOVQKBgQCtJgzJihQsqI28b2+A70RP4DcQLHPaI67pA8pdd97wp1PyR+GqcAjTcinmsX+JPaDrIbJZexfIEi1SDFvvACGEq79XpTkSCDcKDnocLXPMjuJf9/56unasrddv+jjdQvobFinn39O6a2kZRdd7buDbKxFu79OOjEeqX9OYxhZe4QKBgArL0QG4OWERS0AMcxqetHKHXe+SFp8RiROg3nCB4IPBzwA6DeAZd13mTH9f12TBimWIgaDmu0FC/zJdA0PmMKY8x+tcM+heBMvWGroaRRt1iKmW/YeA8s8HhrBGgaN1uGItu/qk1GWi+RtxXWjP1pRgom2469uzOeo60OQEI6NC
```
RSA keys are hardcoded in the application.yml which is not secured

**Recommendation:** Using environment variables (.env) or external secret management will be a better way of maintaining privacy and integrity.

**3.2 Missing Input Validation**
Some endpoints do not have input validation, such as in the authcontroller of the authservice.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive input validation using Bean Validation  for the request coming in.

---
## 4. Messaging Integration

### Strengths

**Event-Driven Architecture:**

Proper use of Spring Cloud Stream with RabbitMQ that implements an orderPlacedEvent, decoupling services and promoting asynchronous communication patterns

### Issues and Recommendations

**4.1 Incomplete Event Handling**
```java
// order-service/src/main/java/com/bytebites/orderservice/service/OrderService.java - Line 45
streamBridge.send("orderPlacedOutput", new OrderPlacedEvent(this, savedOrder.getId(), savedOrder.getCustomerId(), savedOrder.getRestaurantId(), savedOrder.getTotalAmount()));
```
Events are published but no consumer is implemented to consume them on the notification service.

**Recommendation:** Implement event consumers for notification service

**4.2 Missing Error Handling for Messaging**

No dead letter queue configuration and retry mechanisms for failed message processing were implemented to better handle situations of failure.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper error handling and retry logic for robust messaging.

**4.3 Inconsistent Messaging Dependencies**
```xml
<!-- order-service/pom.xml - Lines 45-65 -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
<artifactId>kafka-streams</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
Both RabbitMQ and Kafka dependencies are included but only rabbi

**Recommendation:** Choose one messaging platform and remove unused dependencies

---

## 5. Service Discovery and Configuration

### Strengths

**Eureka Implementation:**

Proper service registration and discovery which allow all services to register with the Eureka server with load balancing through service names

---
## 6. Docker and Deployment Setup

### Critical Missing Components

**6.1 No Docker Implementation**

No Dockerfiles for individual services.A missing docker-compose.yml for local development and container orchestration setup

**Recommendations:**
1. Create Dockerfiles for each service
2. Implement docker-compose.yml for local development
4. Implement multi-stage builds for optimized images to reduce size and fast deplomyent

---

## 7. Data Management and Persistence

### Strengths

**Database Design:**

Entities were well defined and relationships properly implemented. Use of JPA annotations with automatic generation of UUID and auto-increment IDs appropriately used

### Issues and Recommendations

**7.1 Development-Only Database**
```yaml
# All services use H2 in-memory database
datasource:
  url: jdbc:h2:mem:authdb
```
All services use H2 in-memory database for storage and management of data for the services

**Recommendation:** Implement PostgreSQL or MySQL for production

**7.2 Missing Database Migrations**
No Flyway or Liquibase migrations for proper management of database schema changes.

**Recommendation:** Implement database migration tool like fly way to better manage database schema changes by validation.

**Recommendation:** Use records for dtos for clean, immutable design with less boilerplate data carriers.

---

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Areas for Improvement

**8.1 Limited Test Coverage**
- Only basic test classes exist, no integration tests or end-to-end tests

**Recommendations:**
1. Add comprehensive unit tests for each service
2. Implement integration tests with TestContainers

---

## 9. Security Vulnerabilities

### Identified Issues

**10.1 Exposed H2 Console**
```yaml
# auth-service/application.yml - Lines 20-22
h2:
  console:
    enabled: true
    path: /h2-console
```

H2 console is enabled in production configuration though it's the only implemented database been used.

**Recommendation:** Disable in h2 console for production profile or secure with authentication

**10.2 Missing Rate Limiting**

No rate limiting on API endpoints means endpoints can be overloaded with request.
**Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting with Spring Cloud Gateway

**10.3 No CORS Configuration**

No CORS policy defined for external interactions.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper CORS configuration for integration.

---

##  Recommendations

### High Priority (Production Blockers)
1. **Implement Docker containerization**
2. **Add comprehensive error handling**
3. **Add health checks and monitoring**
4. **Fix version inconsistencies**
5. **Add comprehensive testing**
6. **Implement proper database migrations**
7. **Implement Resilience by adding circuit breakers everywhere they are needed**
